Packages for entity tagged query analysis

Requirements



Entity Tagging and query clustering
	Following python packages are required to run respective modules. 
	1. NLTK (stemming)
	2. cluster (k-mediods)
	3. distance (jaccard)
	5. numpy

	Following resources have to be downloaded
	1. dbpedia article category file 
	2. dbpedia entity type file


Files and input parameters

 Feature generation 
	Following features are calculated for each query pair
	1. Session cosine
	2. Ngrams cosine and jaccard
	3. Users cosine
	4. URls cosine
	5. Entity Type cosine
	6. Entity Category cosine
	7. Entity cosine
	
	They are combined by weights (tuned on training dataset) 

	Important files and functions
	1. features/generateEntityFeatures.py : takes query file and tags queries with entity, category and their types
	2. features/formatFeatures.py : takes different files  -- users and urls and sums up features
	3. features/__init__.py : find out weight matrix -- findPairwiseDistance(featFile, outFile)
	4. entity/entity/category/findCategoryClusters.py : finds out clusters per entity type. 


	Steps followed to cluster
	INPUT : Aol-type formated file (tab seperated)
		<uid> query <timestamp> <curl>
	
	1. Tag queries with entities
	2. accumulate all features with following options 
		-- uid : true or false  (whether user id present or not, if not then put in dummy id there)
		-- url : tru or false (whether clicked urls present or not)
		-- wtype : token, phrase or queries
	3. write the feature file
	4. find pairwise similarity
	5. output clusters with following options
		--algo : kmeans or kmed
		--type : wcat or etype
		--wtype : token, phrase, queries
		--csize : cluster size range (llimit , ulimit)
		--out-file : output folder with clusters 
	
	OUTPUT : folder with clusters 
		each file in folder has following format
		-- algoTypeK.txt : number of final clusters (k) computed using algo (algoType)
		-- <type> <wtype> <wtype> .... <wtype>  (tab seperated)  : Each line contains a type (wiki category or type file) and its cluster of wtypes (either words, phrases or queries)
